# Group-Constrained Subject-Specific (GCSS) Analysis: Make Parcels

Greetings! This code is modified from Dr. Terri Scott (https://github.com/tlscott/make_parcels), and can be used to generate a set of parcels from a dataset of individual subject fMRI volumes. Please see the following papers for more on the method:

Her code is based on the watershed algorithm included in this SPM toolbox developed by Alfonso Nieto-Castañon: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/spm_ss


This code requires Freesurfer and Matlab, and if you want to make pretty pictures, python + a whole bunch of packages (numpy, nibabel, matplotlib, nilearn...). In order to generate a report with the approximate locations of parcels, she use atlases from FSL. Found here -> https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases; license here -> https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Licence


To run: use the Make_My_Parcels.m script to call generate_parcels.m. You will need to specify the full paths to each of your subject maps in a cell array, and a set of options.


Included here is part of my (anonymized) data from a Language Localizer Task and an Auditory Statistical Learning task. I have also included the parcels generated using that data. For the Language Localizer Task, these are z-statistic maps of the contrast intact speech > degraded speech during language processing, and for the Auditory Statistical Learning task, these are z-statistic maps of the contrast structured speech > random speech during statistical learning.


Terri also included a python script, plot_parcels.py, that will generate a pdf that you can see in the images directory.
