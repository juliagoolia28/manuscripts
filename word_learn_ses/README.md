Abstract:
Socioeconomic status (SES)-related language gaps are known to widen throughout the course of the school years. Recent evidence suggests that differences in word learning ability contribute to these growing gaps, yet we lack an understanding of what underlies these word learning differences. Such information would inform interventions aimed at helping children learn how to learn. The current study uses multiple regression analyses to examine how cognitive, linguistic, and environmental attributes contribute to gaps in word learning ability among 247 school-aged children from varying SES backgrounds. Vocabulary and reading comprehension emerged as the strongest predictors of a child’s word learning ability. While vocabulary emerged as a critical predictor of word learning ability for all children, having stronger reading abilities early on appears to benefit the word learning abilities of school-aged children from lower SES homes. These findings highlight different paths by which children’s trajectories for acquiring new words may be impacted.
